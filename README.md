Once, after reading the habr.com, I wanted to try to play with mini-boards and all types of sensors (door, move, temperatures and others). The best specification were at Orange Pi at that time and I bought it. Unfortunutle there was no libraries to work with GPIO, there was only one library ported from Raspberry Pi and I did not like how it works. 

So I wrote this little and simple lib. It was a good experience for me, I learned a bit C++ lang and how to work mini-board pins (gpio, uart and other).

But for project more than “blinking LEDs” better use another programing lang.
For example node.js with “on/off” lib.

#### Have a good day!
